# SeismicToolkit
Toolkit for processing seismic data file (SEGY). You can use this toolkit to divide a large SEGY file into small ones, extract certain traces from a large SEGY file, extract the traces according to FFIDs and so on without loading the huge size data into memory. Linux and MATLAB on Windows are supported. 

[segymat](http://segymat.sourceforge.net/) and [SeiSee](https://seisee.software.informer.com/) are recommended for further loading data from MATLAB and visualizing.

 # Examples
1. Extracting all the gathers belong to one FFID

2. Extracting certain traces from SGY file
